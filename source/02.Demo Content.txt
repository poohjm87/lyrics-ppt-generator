This is the second sample file
Showing how multiple files work together
Each file becomes a separate section
With its own title slide

The program reads all text files
From the source directory automatically
Files are processed in alphabetical order
Based on their filename numbers

You can add as many files as needed
Each will get its own section
Blank slides separate different sections
Making navigation clear and easy

Perfect for lyrics presentations
Educational content display
Meeting agendas and outlines
Any text that needs slide formatting

Thank you for using this generator
Feel free to customize and modify
